Thoughtseeds Framework: Vipassana Meditation Simulation

This repository contains the Python implementation of the Thoughtseeds Framework for simulating thought dynamics in focused-attention Vipassana meditation, as described in the paper:

"Thoughtseeds Framework: A Hierarchical and Agentic Framework for Investigating Thought Dynamics in Meditative States"

Overview

The framework models meditative states (breath_control, mind_wandering, meta_awareness, redirect_breath) using a rule-based hybrid learning approach. Thoughtseeds, acting as attentional agents, compete within a Thoughtseed Network to generate state transitions, producing outputs for Figures 4-8 in the paper (weight matrices, activations, state evolution, interaction networks, hierarchical dynamics).
